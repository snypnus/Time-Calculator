# Time-Calculator
This program can be used to add time slots.
Initially, only two slots are used here but it can be simply extended to multiple slots using sone further coding.
This is generally for successive videos or clips of same title needed to be compiled into one time duration.
This code cannot be used for time duration exceeding a single day.
